One of the mods we use in the unit is Persistence, based on Apollo from [Theseus](https://github.com/Theseus-Aegis/Mods). Many thanks to Jonpas and his team for this great mod; we've simply re-implemented the extension in Go, as well as changed some of the SQF around. I am completely new to the CBA/ACE structure of doing things, so excuse any messes on that part, too.

All credit for initial SQF and work goes to Jonpas & his team at Theseus Aegis. There are still references to TAC here and there, and I'll aim to leave any credits behind as they should be.

I'm pretty bad at SQF so excuse any mistakes I've made, and in addition, I'm still learning Go here and there. Note that I'm not planning on supporting this release any time soon; just putting it out there for anyone who might be interested.

Note: serverside code for this will not be open sourced any time soon, it's nasty code anyway and not particularly difficult to implement.

Implemented:
- [x] Player loading and saving (rudimentary)
- [ ] Vehicle loading and saving

Final note: I would **not** call this production ready at this time.
